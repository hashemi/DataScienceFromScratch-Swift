# Data Science from Scratch in Swift

This is a Swift implementation of the contents of the book *Data Science from Scratch, 2nd ed* by Joel Grus. The [original code](https://github.com/joelgrus/data-science-from-scratch) of the book was written in Python.

This is a work in progress. It's organized as Swift playground with a playground page per chapter. The following chapters are currently implemented:

1. Introduction
2. A Crash Course in Python (no Swift code)
3. Visualizing Data (no Swift code)
4. Linear Algebra
5. Statistics
6. Probability
7. Hypothesis and Inference
8. Gradient Descent
